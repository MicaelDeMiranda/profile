      <h1>My hobbies :</h1>

      <h2>ðŸŽ® Video Games and Streaming ðŸŽ®</h2>
        <p>I started playing <strong>Video Games</strong> when I was 3 with my brother, uncle and dad! We would play hours upon hours at Yoshi's Island, Donkey Kong Country and Star Wars! It ignited the passion of Art and Interactivity in me and I never stopped since!</p>

        <p>After Highschool I still loved Video Games so much that I went to study how to create them and got a Masters' Degree in Game and Level Design in 2014!</p>

        <p>I then discovered Streaming when it came out, and always had the dream of having my own channel where I could share my love for Video Games and show people that they are works of Art!</p>

        <p>Finally, in 2019 I took a sabbatical from my job and did it! I created my own Streaming channel and my own YouTube channel as well! It was the most fun year I had! I met lots of people and created incredible memories that I'll cherish for the rest of my life!</p>

        <p>You can check my videos on YouTube at this address <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sphaax" target="_blank" class="button"> <strong> <em>My YouTube Channel</em></strong> </a></p>

      <h2>ðŸŽ§ Music and Singing ðŸŽ¤</h2>
        <p>I started <em><strong>Singing</strong></em> when I was really young too, and I never stopped as well!</p>

        <p>I never took any singing lessons or sang in front of professionals because I'm really shy, but Music and Singing bring me so much joy I wouldn't be able to function without them!!</p>

    <div class="container card">
      <h2>ðŸˆ³ Learning languages ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§</h2>
        <p>I started learning different languages from my birth language (French) right after being born because we were Portuguese growing up in France! So we learned both <strong><em>French</em></strong> and <strong><em>Portuguese</em></strong>! I then learned <strong><em>Spanish</em></strong> and <strong><em>English</em></strong> at school, and always loved it immensely!</p>

        <p>Since then I improved all of those a lot! I got 960/1000 at the English TOEIC, am completely fluent in French, can hold a conversation in Spanish and Portuguese and I also studied <strong><em>Japanese</em></strong> for 2 years during my Masters' Degree!</p>

        <p>You can now understand how much I love languages! It's sooo fun learning all the little rules and intricacies each new one has, and the power they have in connecting human beings is simply incredible!!</p>
